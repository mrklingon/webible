BREAK UP WEB.GBF File : (requires you go to WEB page
http://www.ebible.org and get the most recent zip file, unzip it in
the directory in which webible is.)

./webible SPLIT
Directory already exists
making >web.dir/1.web
making >web.dir/2.web
making >web.dir/3.web
making >web.dir/4.web......
making >web.dir/66.web......

	  {this breaks the text into 66 unique files)

The same command works for the KJV.GBF file (download at 
        URL: http://www.ebible.org/bible/kjv/kjvgbf.zip)

./kjbible SPLIT
making >kjv.dir/1.web
making >kjv.dir/2.web
making >kjv.dir/3.web....
making >kjv.dir/81.web......

	  {this breaks the text into 81 unique files; includes
		the Apocyrpha)

The Douay and Vulgate are already split, just unzip the drv.zip or vul.zip file
in the directory you put the Bible programs.
